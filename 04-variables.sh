# Variables: 
# This is a very important concept in any programming language or technology.
# Without this, it's quite tough to see the quality of the code or the script
# Just by looking at the script and the usage of variables, we can say how good the script is.
# Variables are used to store the data and to use it whenever required.
# a=100 

# In bash, there is no concept of data types
# In programming languages like C, C++, Java, Python, etc., we have data types like int, float, char, etc.

# How do you define a variable in bash? a=10, a=abc, c=10.5, etc.
# There are no data types in bash. By default, everything is a string in bash.
# In bash, we don't have to declare the variables. We can directly assign the values to the variables.
 
# Syntax: VAR=DATA 
# a=10 ( delcaring a variable a and assigning a value 10 to it) 
# How to print this ? special characters are used to print the variables..
# $varName is going to print the value of the variable when used with echo command. 

a=10
echo "Printing the value of a $a"
echo "Printing the value of b $b"
# When you attempt to print the value of a variable that is not defined, it will print the empty value. 

# echo deleting the data
# rm -rf /data/$DATADIR  # rm /data/

# $a or ${a} or "${a}" 
echo "Printing the value of a $a"
echo "Printing the value of a ${a}"
echo Printing the value of a ${a}
echo 'Printing the value of a ${a}'
# when you enclose any variable in single quotes, it will print the variable name as it is. That also means, single quotes will elimiate the special variables power.

# TODAYS_DATE="2025-03-06"
TODAYS_DATE=$(date +%F)
echo "Today's date is $TODAYS_DATE" 
# Demo to use expression via parathesis ()
echo "Number of logged sessions on the server = $(who | wc -l)"



#  Variable names can be either upper case or lower case or we can also use the combination of both.
# in bash there is no restirction on it.
# As NFR, we should always use the variable names in upper case or lower case in the entire script.

# VARNAME: Upper case 
# varname: lower case
# varName: camel case
# var_name: snake case
